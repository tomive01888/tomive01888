# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS, at Noroff Frontend-developer course in 1st year. Now soon headed over to 2nd year for frameworks and more.

# About me
I am in pursuit of an education as frontend-developer at <a href="https://www.noroff.no/" target="_blank">Noroff Education</a>. I like to create and breathe life into creations others have designed or something I personally have designed myself.

In my freetime I like to play videogames, watch YouTube videos about frogs, solo camping and any videogame related videos, and the occasional play-around in VS code with any APIs I find interesting.
